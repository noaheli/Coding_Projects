Interview Question: Wildfire Suppression in a Forest
Problem Statement
You are given an N x M grid representing a forest where:

T (Tree): Flammable trees that can catch fire.
F (Fire): Fire spreads every tick to adjacent trees (up, down, left, right).
S (Fire Station): A fire station that generates a firefighter every tick.
. (Empty Space): Empty spaces that do not burn and can be walked on.
W (Wall): Obstacles that neither fire nor firefighters can pass through.
Each tick, two things happen:

Fire Spreads: Any tree (T) adjacent to fire (F) catches fire.
Firefighters Move: Firefighters move toward the nearest fire and extinguish it when they reach it. If multiple fires are equidistant, they choose arbitrarily.
Your goal is to simulate the fire spread and suppression process until the fire is completely extinguished or no more trees are left to burn.
